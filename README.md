My Personal Blog
================

I built it using Gatsby. I stared with [gatsby-personal-starter-blog](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog) but added following features on top of it.

- Dark / Light Theme
- Table of Contents with scroll spy
- Pages support to showcase my projects and work experience.
- Sub Pages support
- Twitter cards

I will soon write blog on how I implemented these features. So star this repo :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.
