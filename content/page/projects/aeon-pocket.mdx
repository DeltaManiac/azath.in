This was a joint venture by my close friend [Pushkar Anand](https://twitter.com/pushkar8723). We did it just on a whim during the whole global crypto/blockchain trend.

 So I found out about a privacy focused coin [AEON](https://www.aeon.cash/). A fork of
[Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) but uses [the CryptoNight-Lite](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/CryptoNight-Lite)
hashing algorithm so that it can be mined on CPU and doesn't necessarily need a powerful GPU or miner or so.

### Learning 

We came to know about a web wallet bounty and quickly tried our hands at it thinking it was a simple `CRUD` kind of applicatio.

> Boy were we WRONG!!!

Like Monero, AEON, works with two cryptographic keys. One for identifying transactions (known as view key) and another for transferring some AEON to 
another wallet (known as spend key). These keys are in themselves a Public and Private Key pair. A Wallet (The place where AEONS live) is identified by a unique address called the wallet address.
It is generated as a combination of both the public view key and the public spend key. In simple words the private view key is used to scan the blockchain for transactions that belong to your wallet,
and the private spend key is used to sign a transaction and send it to the the AEON network to be verified and add to the Blockcain.

The major challenge was in order to keep the wallet secure we did not want to transfer the spend key to our server ever. Meaning, to sync a wallet, we need to send each block from the blockchain to the client and then
rely on the client to identify a transaction and inform the server about it. This means that our server could not do a background sync of the wallet. So we resorted to storing the blocks identified with the transactions on the server.

However, after 90 days of hard work, coffee, sleepless nights and loong discord calls, we solved the problem. We announced the [beta release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/7qceqa/aeon_pocket_secure_web_wallet_for_aeon/)
on AEON's Reddit thread. More than 100 wallets were created on the very first day. And after a month it settled down todaily 25 active users. People liked what we did. We even got some free media coverage.

We event created a small monitoring stack that monitors the servers health, database storage and logs with [Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata) and [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/downloads) and a setup a telegram bot as a poor man's subsitute for 24x7.
This worked for a while but we further ran into a few hiccups which made us shutdown the project. 

### What went wrong?

 AEON decided to change its internal workings and it required the user to resync their wallet from the start of the block. A very heavy transaction for us. 
We made it through somehow only to realize that there were other such milestones planned. And some of it may require us to rewrite the entire thing.

Then there was this other very human challenge involved. As AEON is a crypto-currency, money is involved. Many people do
trading on it and make their livelihood from it. Since, we were the only web wallet for AEON, some even relied on it to be up 24x7 (92% uptime was what we had)
While both of us had to do our full-time day jobs to pay our bills. We also hadn't foreseen how much of database space would be consumed in storing the blocks associatd with the user on our server,
this meant there were a few downtimes because the DB Volume became full.

Needless to say, whenever any issue happened someone loses their money and we would be at the receiving end of their rage.

Keeping all these factors in mind we decided to deprecate the project. And with a heavy heart we announced that [we would
go offline on 30th September 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/9dw2vl/aeon_pocket_shutting_down_on_30th_september_2018/).

The source code is available on [Github]() for you to poke around and have fun and learn.
