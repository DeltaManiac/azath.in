> A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it - Franh Herbert

Like most employees at a workplace, I spend a lot of my time understanding and solving problems for the company that helps me chase my passion (including this blog). I've only worked in 1 company, but I've worked across a multitude of domains all with different problems to solve.
So, here I list them down.

## SAP Labs India 

### Senior Developer

    Developer        | April 2017 - March 2020

I moved on to the [SAP Document Center](https://mdocs.sap.com/mcm/public/start/index.jsp) product as a core backend developer. Here I started working by writing bridge API's  for document management adhering to the [Content Management Interoperbility Services](https://chemistry.apache.org/project/cmis.html) which is a standard for Enterprise Content Management. Shortly afterwards I started on working on redesigning, planning and migrating the existing application from the Proprietary Cloud Stack (NEO) on [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/index.html) to the [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) based Open Stack on SAP Cloud Platform. The redesign phase of this produce provided challenges which including in redesign the product to integrate with dynamically provisioned and scaled resources on the fly. The new redesigned service [Document Management](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/servicessearch/document%20management) helped me learn and apply the design patterns for a distributed monolith based architecture. I worked on integrating this service with the broader products of SAP ERP Domain applications like the [Document Management System](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/PLM/SAP+Document+Management+System). I had the unique opportunity of writing a custom [route service](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html) in Go to have a weighted rate limiting based on service plans. Working to migrate the application to work on Azure Landscape of SAP Cloud Platform required me to accomodate my self with [Azure Blob Store Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)

**TechStack:** JavaEE, CloudFoundry, Go
###  Associate Developer
<pre>
    Associate Developer | August 2014 - March 2017
</pre>
I joined the [SAP Mobile Secure](https://portal.sapmobilesecure.com/) team. This team worked on [MDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) platform for SAP.
I was involved in [Android for Work integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/05/18/introducing-android-for-work-for-sap-mobile-secure/)
on the platform and was responsible for designing and developing a [cloud build service for Fiori Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/24/create-a-fiori-client-with-the-cloud-build-service-for-on-premise-fiori-launchpad/). Here I had an immense amount of learning on how to build a service End-to-End. I had created a secure Docker based build infrastructure for isolated parallel builds and created "templated builds" to improve the throughput of the service. It also gave me an opportunity to write Sensu checks to enable our inhouse monitoring system to keep an eye on the server load and health. This was also a great opportunity for me to collaborate with different teams within the company to onboard them to our service and troubleshoot integration issues as well as the [Cordova Framework](https://cordova.apache.org/). I had also co-designed and authored a Custom Round Robin Load Balancer for throttling and balancing the load on the build server farm.

**TechStack:** PHP, JavaScript, SAP Ui5, Cordova, Docker, Sensu, NodeJs
