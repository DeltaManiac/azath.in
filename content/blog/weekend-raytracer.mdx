I spent 7 days going through <a href="https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a> and learnt a few things.

I have never done serious graphics programming in my life, yes I have tinkered with OpenGL and drawn multi colored triangles but thats about it. So I sat down and spent some time writing one in rust and its been a great experience.

## Things I learnt

1. Operator Overloading

   Operator overloading in rust is suprisingly straight forward and trait based. The `std::ops` define the traits that can be overloaded or implemented for your type.

   To implement the `+` operator and `+=` for a custom struct Vec3 we have to implement the `std::ops::Add` and the `std::ops::AddAssign` traits repectively.

   ```rust
   pub struct Vec3 {
      e: [f64; 3],
   }

   impl Add for Vec3 {
       type Output = Vec3;

       fn add(self, other: Vec3) -> Vec3 {
         Vec3 {
             e: [
                 self.e[0] + other.e[0],
                 self.e[1] + other.e[1],
                 self.e[2] + other.e[2],
             ],
          }
       }
   }

   impl AddAssign for Vec3 {
      fn add_assign(&mut self, other: Vec3) {
           *self = Vec3 {
               e: [
                   self.e[0] + other.e[0],
                   self.e[1] + other.e[1],
                   self.e[2] + other.e[2],
               ],
           };
       }
   }
   ```

2. Ray tracing is hard ?!
